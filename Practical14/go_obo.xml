If you are trying to make an annotation to x phase, it is likely that the correct annotation is 'regulation of x/y phase transition' or to a process which occurs during the reported phase (i.e mitotic DNA replication for mitotic S-phase). To capture the phase when a specific location or process is observed, the phase term can be used in an annotation extension (PMID:24885854) applied to a cellular component term (with the relation exists_during) or a biological process term (with the relation happens_during). gocheck_do_not_annotate GO:0051326 part_of GO:0000087 GO:0000094 obsolete septin assembly and septum formation biological_process OBSOLETE (was not defined before being made obsolete). go_curators GOC This term was made obsolete because it was not defined and the string name implied two separate processes. septin assembly and septum formation 1 GO:0000917 GO:0000918 GO:0000921 GO:0000095 S-adenosyl-L-methionine transmembrane transporter activity molecular_function GO:0015177 Enables the transfer of S-adenosylmethionine from one side of a membrane to the other.

To minimize ambiguity in the use of the word "promoter" in GO, we have chosen the phrase "transcription regulatory region" in order to refer to all of the regulatory regions. Regulatory regions in the DNA which control initiation may include the "core promoter" where the basal transcription machinery binds, the "core promoter proximal region" where regulatory factors other than the basal machinery bind, and "enhancer" regions which are typically more distal from the core promoter. There are also additional regulatory regions, in both the DNA and the RNA transcript, which regulate elongation or termination of transcription.

The core promoter is composed of the transcription start site and binding sites for the RNA polymerase and the basal transcription machinery. The transcribed region might be described as a gene, cistron, or operon. pg GOC txnOH GOC The word "promoter" is used variously in the literature to describe the core promoter specifically or the entire proximal regulatory region (excluding any distal enhancers) including both the core promoter and the upstream region where activating transcription factors such as Gal4 in S. cerevisiae or catabolite activator protein (CAP) in E. coli bind. To minimize ambiguity in the use of the word "promoter" in GO, we have chosen the phrase "transcription regulatory region" in order to refer to all of the regulatory regions. Regulatory regions in the DNA which control initiation may include the "core promoter" where the basal transcription machinery binds, the "core promoter proximal region" where regulatory factors other than the basal machinery bind, and "enhancer" regions which are typically more distal from the core promoter. There are also additional regulatory regions, in both the DNA and the RNA transcript, which regulate elongation or termination of transcription. ANNOTATION NOTE: Regarding annotation to "transcription regulatory region DNA binding" (GO:0044212) and any of its is_a children, note that annotation to these terms specifies DNA binding only without any statement about transcription factor activity. To make an annotation about a function of transcription factor activity, consider "sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factor activity" (GO:0003700) or its is_a children which have has_part relationships to the appropriate kind of "transcription regulatory region DNA binding".

This process involves transfer of a sulfur from cysteine to position C2 by several steps. 16871210 PMID In E. coli, the first step of the reaction is reductive elimination of sulfur from L-cysteine by IscS cysteine desulfurase to form an enzyme-bound cysteine-persulfide intermediate. Then, five essential gene products, TusA, TusB, TusC, TusD and TusE, mediate a sulfur relay that delivers the terminal sulfur of persulfide from IscS to MnmA12. The last protein, MnmA catalyzes the transfer of the sulfur from IscS to an ATP activated U34 of the tRNA. tRNA wobble uridine thiolation mah GOC wobble position s2U biosynthesis GO:0002098 GO:0034227 GO:0002144 cytosolic tRNA wobble base thiouridylase complex cellular_component A complex of two proteins involved in the thiolation of U34 in glutamate, lysine, and glutamine tRNAs of eukaryotes. 18391219 PMID Cut1-Cut2 complex tRNA thiouridylase GO:0032991 GO:0044445 GO:0002145 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine diphosphatase activity molecular_function Catalysis of the reaction: 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine pyrophosphate + H2O = hydroxymethylpyrimidine phosphate + phosphate + H(+).

Recombined receptors for antigen encoded by immunoglobulin superfamily domains include T cell receptors and immunoglobulins (antibodies) produced by B cells. The first encounter with antigen elicits a primary immune response that is slow and not of great magnitude. T and B cells selected by antigen become activated and undergo clonal expansion. A fraction of antigen-reactive T and B cells become memory cells, whereas others differentiate into effector cells. The memory cells generated during the primary response enable a much faster and stronger secondary immune response upon subsequent exposures to the same antigen (immunological memory).

Gene_Ontology 1 GO:0003674 molecular_function molecular_function GO:0005554 A molecular process that can be carried out by the action of a single macromolecular machine, usually via direct physical interactions with other molecular entities. Function in this sense denotes an action, or activity, that a gene product (or a complex) performs. These actions are described from two distinct but related perspectives: (1) biochemical activity, and (2) role as a component in a larger system/process. pdt GOC Note that, in addition to forming the root of the molecular function ontology, this term is recommended for use for the annotation of gene products whose molecular function is unknown. When this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the molecular function of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code "no data" (ND), is used to indicate this. Despite its name, this is not a type of 'function' in the sense typically defined by upper ontologies such as Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). It is instead a BFO:process carried out by a single gene product or complex. goslim_aspergillus goslim_candida goslim_chembl goslim_generic goslim_metagenomics goslim_pir goslim_plant goslim_yeast

Catalysis of the reaction: (5-L-glutamyl)-peptide + an amino acid = peptide + 5-L-glutamyl-amino acid. 2.3.2.2 EC This term was obsoleted because it does not correspond to a physiological reaction.nUsage comment: The gene family commonly referred to as gamma-glutamyl transferases (GGT) catalyze hydrolysis of gamma-glutamyl bonds in gamma-glutamyl compounds such as glutathione. In a test tube one can set up conditions in which the enzyme will transfer the gamma-glutamyl portion of the substrate to an acceptor molecule, but this requires non-physiologic conditions, including millmolar concentrations of an acceptor such as glygly. This reaction is used in assays to detect the presence of the enzyme, but is not a physiological function of members of the GGT family (PMC4388159), which should be annotated to a suitable hydrolysis term instead (e.g. glutathione hydrolase activity).

Based on the formative feedback, I have made the following improvements:

As for Practical3:

I,As for Relocated Reflection.txt:

I had mistakenly placed Reflection.txt in the wrong folder. I have now moved it back to the correct Practical3 directory.

II,Improved Content of thingsIlike.txt and Introductions.txt:

I revised and enhanced the contents of both thingsIlike.txt and Introductions.txt to better reflect the task requirements and improve clarity.

III,Updated Commit Messages:

I replaced the vague commit message '2' with more informative descriptions, such as:

1, Improved content in thingsIlike.txt

2, Edited Introductions.txt for being detailed

3, For the Reflection.txt, Reset the incorrect file location

As for Practical4:

I add the missing comment in variables.py with keeping the previous output which the professor liked.

As for Practical5:

I have received 100% so no changes were necessary.

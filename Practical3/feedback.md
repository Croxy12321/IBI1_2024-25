Based on the formative feedback, I have made the following improvements:

Relocated Reflection.txt
I had mistakenly placed Reflection.txt in the wrong folder. I have now moved it back to the correct Practical3 directory.

Improved Content of thingsIlike.txt and Introductions.txt
I revised and enhanced the contents of both thingsIlike.txt and Introductions.txt to better reflect the task requirements and improve clarity.

Updated Commit Messages
I replaced the vague commit message '2' with more informative descriptions, such as:
Improved content in thingsIlike.txt
Edited Introductions.txt for being detailed
Moved Reflection.txt to Practical3 folder
